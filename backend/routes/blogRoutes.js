// This code defines the routes for the blog functionality in an Express application.
// It imports the necessary modules, sets up a router, and defines two routes:
// 1. A GET route at the root path ('/') that retrieves all blogs by calling the `getBlogs` controller function.
// 2. A POST route at the root path ('/') that creates a new blog by calling the `createBlog` controller function.
// Finally, it exports the router so that it can be used in the main application file.
// This modular approach helps keep the code organized and maintainable, allowing for easy addition of more routes in the future if needed.
